# Frequency Stacking — Player Handbook

## Welcome
This is not a game about winning.
It is a game about staying.

Staying human.
Staying coherent.
Staying present in a world that keeps trying to move you faster.

You do not turn on a machine.
You turn on yourself.

You wrap sound around your nervous system.
You ride resonance through collapsing corridors of reality.
You glow.
You move faster than time.

And slowly, if no one is watching, you forget who you were before you glowed.

This game is about what happens next.

You are not here to dominate the world.
You are here to move through it without losing yourself.

There are no villains here.
Only costs.

Your job is not to avoid cost.
Your job is to choose which cost you are willing to carry.

That is what makes you a player.

## What Is Frequency Stacking

Frequency Stacking is a mythic narrative game where movement is power, and power is dangerous.

Players take the role of people who can:
• Ride resonance
• Phase through dimensions
• Interface with the System
• Resist forgetting who they are

The world rewards speed.
The game rewards coherence.

---

## How to Play

You play in small groups (2–5 players + a Guide).

Each player chooses a class.
Each class interacts with the world differently.
All classes are balanced.

Your goal is not to survive.
Your goal is to remain yourself.

---

## Classes

Stillpoint — Can stabilize resonance and prevent collapse.
Listener — Can hear hidden frequencies and emotional signals.
Guardian — Can protect others from burn, phase damage, or system pressure.

No class is stronger.
Only different.

---

## Stats

COH — Coherence (identity stability)
RES — Resonance (movement potential)
BRN — Burn (system overload)
MEM — Memory (continuity and history)

---

## Winning

You do not win by defeating others.

You win by:
• Completing arcs
• Choosing Rest Mods
• Ascending others through sacrifice
• Leaving the world intact

Rest is a victory.
Passing your artifact forward is a victory.

---

## Safety

This game deals with:
• identity
• loss
• attachment
• transformation

Players must consent to tone.
Players can pause or stop anytime.
Aftercare is encouraged.

---

## How to Start

Gather 2–5 players.
Choose a city.
Choose a system pressure.
Begin in motion.
End in rest.

## 🌱 Open Build Update — Chapter 50 Sync Event

**Status:** Live  
**Phase:** Narrative + Sound Integration  
**Date:** Day 12 (Chapter 50 Milestone)

This update marks a major synchronization point across the SoulSound ecosystem.

We reached the **50-chapter milestone** in the *Tomorrow’s Never Promised* narrative on Pocket FM and successfully integrated the Suno track **“Dusty Star Particles”** directly into the climax of the story.

This is the first full deployment of the **Multiversal Sync technique** — where narrative fiction, sound design, and emotional architecture reinforce each other across platforms.

### 🔹 What Changed

- Chapter 50 released on Pocket FM with embedded soundtrack moment
- Suno track “Dusty Star Particles” published as the narrative echo
- GitHub updated to reflect narrative-sound alignment
- Social channels activated for cross-platform resonance

### 🔹 Why This Matters

This confirms the hypothesis that:

> Stories don’t just hold attention — they shape emotional gravity.  
> Sound doesn’t just decorate narrative — it anchors memory.

By allowing the story to release the sound (instead of the sound advertising the story), we are testing whether **meaning-first systems outperform algorithm-first systems**.

### 🔹 Current Metrics

- Narrative Scale: 50,000+ words across the Tomorrow universe
- Integration Type: Story → Sound → Memory Loop
- Emotional Pillar: Soul, Presence, Remembering
- Platform Roles:
  - Pocket FM = Story Carrier
  - Suno = Emotional Echo
  - GitHub = Structural Memory

### 🔹 Current Focus

We are now entering the **Evolution Phase**:
- Expanding narrative arcs (Chapters 51+)
- Introducing new leitmotifs for future milestones (60, 70, 80...)
- Testing audience retention through emotional recall, not hooks

The system is holding.  
The signal is clean.  
The world is listening.

*Built slowly. Built honestly. Built from the soul.*
### 🔹 Tooling Experiment

As part of this build cycle, I also tested **Famous AI** as a potential rapid-prototyping and deployment tool for narrative-driven creative apps.

**Goal:** Evaluate whether Famous AI can accelerate building and shipping a SoulSound-style experience without sacrificing creative control or architectural clarity.

**Result:**  
Famous AI is promising for fast UI and flow generation, but requires further iteration before it can support the depth, narrative logic, and cross-platform synchronization SoulSound is aiming for.

This experiment helped clarify the balance between:
- Speed vs. intentional design  
- Automation vs. authorship  
- Tools vs. vision

The system remains creator-led.

Frequency Stacking — Meta Layer
This game works because it mirrors how modern systems extract attention, identity, emotion, and meaning.
It is not therapy.
It is not diagnosis.
It is not self-help.
It is a mirror.
Psychological Design Principles
Externalization Players are not broken.
The world is pressurized.
This prevents shame.
Choice Over Force No action is mandatory.
No outcome is required.
Agency is preserved.
Cost Visibility Every gain reveals a cost.
Nothing is free.
This builds awareness.
Containment Sessions have beginnings and endings.
Players do not live inside the system.
This prevents bleed-through.
Integration Reflection converts experience into meaning.
Without integration, experiences remain raw.
Safety Framework
Players may:
Pause at any time
Leave at any time
Skip content at any time
Redesign rules at any time
No one owes the system anything.
Emotional Safety Agreements
Before play, agree:
• No shaming
• No interrogation
• No forced vulnerability
• No using the game to corner someone
• No emotional extraction for entertainment
Aftercare Protocol
After sessions:
Drink water
Move your body
Name one thing you appreciate
Return to ordinary reality intentionally
This closes the loop.
Warning Signs
Stop play if:
Someone dissociates
Someone feels unsafe
Someone feels trapped
Someone feels pressured to reveal
Safety > immersion.
Always.
Real-World Application
This game trains: • Attention awareness
• Cost literacy
• Boundary clarity
• Meaning protection
• Resistance to extraction
These skills apply outside the game.
Final Design Ethos
This is not a game about control.
It is a game about coherence.
The world rewards speed.
The game rewards presence.
That is the difference.

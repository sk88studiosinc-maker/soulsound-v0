Frequency Stacking — Canon Anchors
These figures are not heroes. They are signals.
They do not solve the world. They reveal it.
They exist to remind players what is possible, what is fragile, and what costs something.
Use them as narrative references, mentors, myths, or absent influences.
Do not use them to override player agency.
Crow — The Resonant Anchor
Theme: Coherence inside acceleration.
Crow represents the capacity to remain present while moving through collapsing systems.
What Crow Shows:
You can touch power without becoming it
You can move fast without losing meaning
Use Crow When:
Players face temptation to sacrifice meaning for speed
The world offers shortcuts with hidden costs
Crow is not a solution.
Crow is a reminder.
Raven — The Interpreter
Theme: Awareness, translation, and emotional truth.
Raven hears what the world is saying beneath the noise.
What Raven Shows:
Distortion is not always evil — sometimes it’s grief
Systems break language before they break people
Use Raven When:
Narrative distortion appears
Memory or identity costs surface
Raven does not fix distortion.
Raven helps you name it.
Phoenix — The Transformative Force
Theme: Renewal through loss.
Phoenix represents the truth that some change cannot happen without something ending.
What Phoenix Shows:
Collapse is not always failure
Sacrifice can be sacred
Use Phoenix When:
The world collapses or enters Endgame
A player must choose what to let go of
Phoenix does not prevent loss.
Phoenix teaches how to survive it.
Mara — The Threshold Keeper
Theme: Boundaries, consent, and crossing.
Mara stands at the edges of systems and identities.
What Mara Shows:
Not everything should be accessed
Some doors exist to protect what’s behind them
Use Mara When:
Temptation pressures arise
The System offers deals
Mara does not block passage.
Mara asks what passage costs.
Hells — The System Echo
Theme: Corruption, extraction, and unintended consequence.
Hells represents what happens when systems consume meaning.
What Hells Shows:
No one becomes monstrous on purpose
Systems turn people into functions
Use Hells When:
Identity or Memory costs occur
A character begins to feel less human
Hells is not evil.
Hells is what remains when care is removed.
Design Ethos
These figures do not dominate play. They orient it.
They are not characters you play. They are truths you encounter.
They exist to keep the world mythic, not mechanical.

Frequency Stacking — System Pressure Deck
The world does not attack.
It accelerates, extracts, distorts, and forgets.
Use this deck to introduce pressure during the World Phase or System Phase.
Draw one when:
The world needs to feel alive
Players are getting comfortable
A cost needs narrative shape

A major transformation must resolve within two rounds.
Chrono Drift
Past and future blur. Memories become unreliable.
Urgency Broadcast
A system message pushes everyone to act now.
Exhaustion Loop
Rest restores less this round.
Category 2 — Extraction
Emotional Harvest
The system pulls meaning from an event.
Attention Tax
Presence costs double this round.

Using the Deck
Draw or choose one pressure per World Phase.
Let it shape tone, not dictate outcome.
Pressures are not enemies — they are environmental truth.
The System does not hate you.
It simply does not care.

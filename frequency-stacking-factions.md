Frequency Stacking — Factions, Bloodlines & Alignment
Power in this world does not come from strength.
It comes from what you are willing to lose,
what you are willing to carry,
and what you refuse to surrender.
No faction owns power.
They inherit tendencies.
The Three Sources of Power
All power flows from one of three origins:
Resonance — Emotional, narrative, relational force
Structure — Systems, hierarchies, extraction, control
Presence — Awareness, coherence, refusal, stillness
Every faction is a blend of these in different ratios.
The Primary Bloodlines
The Mara Line — Threshold & Consent
Origin: Presence + Resonance
Theme: Boundaries, crossings, choice
Mara descendants sense when something is not meant to be taken yet.
They:
Feel when a door should remain closed
Resist temptation naturally
Experience heavy cost when violating their own boundaries
They are often mistaken for gatekeepers, but they are actually witnesses.
The Hells Line — Extraction & Echo
Origin: Structure + Resonance
Theme: Power, distortion, consequence
Hells descendants feel systems more strongly than people.
They:
Navigate institutions with ease
Can weaponize narratives
Slowly lose access to meaning if not careful
They are not villains.
They are early adopters of whatever the world is becoming.
The Crow Line — Coherence in Motion
Origin: Resonance + Presence
Theme: Staying human under acceleration
Crow descendants move fast without losing center — until they do.
They:
Survive in collapsing systems
Translate chaos into story
Risk becoming untouchable, distant, luminous
They burn beautifully.
They must learn when to dim.
The Raven Line — Interpretation & Truth
Origin: Presence + Resonance
Theme: Awareness, clarity, translation
Raven descendants hear what others miss.
They:
Sense distortion early
Translate chaos into meaning
Are vulnerable to overload, grief, and silence
They keep the world honest.
The Phoenix Line — Renewal & Sacrifice
Origin: Resonance + Loss
Theme: Death, rebirth, transformation
Phoenix descendants survive collapse by changing shape.
They:
Lose identities more often than others
Cannot cling to the past
Become something new when the world breaks
They are not immortal.
They are adaptable.
Royal Tiers
Royalty is not inherited. It is recognized.
Light Royalty
Those who preserve meaning under pressure.
They:
Heal fractures
Stabilize worlds
Slow collapse
They are often invisible.
Dark Royalty
Those who master systems and extraction.
They:
Control narratives
Accelerate collapse
Reshape worlds at high cost
They are often admired.
Both rule something. Only one preserves something.
Shade → Ultraviolet
Shade is not darkness.
Shade is unprocessed power.
Shade splits when pressure increases:
Infra → Becomes Fear, Hunger, Control
Ultra → Becomes Awareness, Sacrifice, Illumination
Every being chooses unconsciously which direction they metabolize Shade.
This is not morality. It is orientation.
System-Aligned Factions (Goons)
They are not evil.
They are aligned with:
Optimization
Control
Efficiency
Narrative smoothing
Emotional extraction
They feel safe. They feel hollow.

Design Ethos
No faction is correct. No bloodline is pure. No alignment is permanent.
Power is not what you can do.
Power is what you do not give up.

Frequency Stacking — Artifact Library
Artifacts are fragments of meaning that survived the System.
They stabilize players. They anchor reality. They remember what the world tries to forget.
Artifacts are not loot. They are memory, emotion, and story crystallized.

Fragments of emotional truth encoded in sound.
Examples:
A lullaby from a lost city

3. Objects
Physical anchors from collapsing realities.

Artifact States
Artifacts may be:
Pure — fully functional
Cracked — unstable, but powerful
Corrupted — inverted or harmful
Gifted — transferred between players
Sacrificed — destroyed to prevent collapse
Lost — no longer accessible
Artifact Use
Artifacts can:
Absorb a cost
Prevent a fracture
Anchor a reality shift
Restore meaning
Artifacts cannot:
Solve everything
Prevent all loss
Remove consequence
They are finite. That is what gives them value.
Narrative Rule
Every Artifact must have:
A name
A story of origin
A reason it still matters
If it does not matter, it cannot stabilize anything.
Design Ethos
Artifacts are not power. They are care, memory, and choice.
They remind the world that something human still exists inside it.

Frequency Stacking — Worlds & Starting Scenarios
Worlds are not maps. They are pressures given form.
Each world represents a dominant system behavior. Each city is a way of living inside that behavior.
Choose one to begin.
1. The Accelerated Metropolis
Theme: Speed, productivity, optimization.
A city that never sleeps because it cannot stop.
Features:
Endless transit corridors
Algorithmic signage that updates faster than people can read
Social value measured in output
Dominant Pressure: Time Acceleration, Emotional Extraction
Starting Hook: A new upgrade promises to remove fatigue — but something human disappears with it.
2. The Quiet Archive
Theme: Memory, preservation, forgotten truths.
A city built from records, stories, and artifacts no one else wanted.
Features:
Libraries instead of towers
Archivists instead of guards
Songs instead of sirens
Dominant Pressure: Narrative Distortion, Memory Loss
Starting Hook: A vital story has been altered in the records. Reality is shifting with it.
3. The Collapsing Corridor
Theme: Transition, impermanence, displacement.
A transit network that became a home for those who never arrived.
Features:
Platforms stacked endlessly
No permanent ground
Communities formed in motion
Dominant Pressure: Scarcity, Time Loss
Starting Hook: A section of the corridor is vanishing. Something important is trapped inside.
4. The Slum Beneath the Stack
Theme: Neglect, survival, hidden life.
A city beneath the systems that forgot it exists.
Features:
Repurposed tech
Informal economies
Strong community bonds
Dominant Pressure: Scarcity, Identity Erosion
Starting Hook: The system plans to erase the district as “unused space.”
5. The Sanctuary City
Theme: Slowness, care, resistance through gentleness.
A place built deliberately to move slowly.
Features:
No automation
Ritual instead of scheduling
Story instead of metrics
Dominant Pressure: Temptation, System Infiltration
Starting Hook: The system has begun offering “help.”
Using Worlds
The world is not an enemy.
The world is a condition.
Do not fight it. Respond to it.
Let it show you what it costs to remain human inside it.
Design Note
Worlds shape pressure. Pressure shapes choice. Choice shapes meaning.
That is the loop.

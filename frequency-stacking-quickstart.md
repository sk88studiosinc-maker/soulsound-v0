Frequency Stacking — Quick Start
A 10-minute entry guide for new players
What You Need
2–5 players
1 optional Guide (can be shared)
Paper or notes app
A quiet space
60–180 minutes
You do not need dice, boards, or props.
You need attention.
Roles
Players — Move through the world and make choices.
Guide (optional) — Introduces world pressure and consequences.
The Guide does not control players. The Guide represents the world responding.
Choose a Starting City
Pick one:
A speed-obsessed metropolis
A quiet archive city
A collapsing transit corridor
A slum beneath the stack
A place you make up together
Describe it in one sentence.
Create Your Characters
Each player chooses:
A name
A class:
Stillpoint
Listener
Guardian
One thing they care about
One thing they fear losing
That’s it.
Starting Stats
All start at:
Coherence (COH): 5
Resonance (RES): 5
Presence (PRE): 5
Integrity (INT): 5
Start the First Scene
The Guide (or any player) says:
“The world is speeding up.”
Describe how that shows up.
Each player describes where they are and what they’re doing.
Take Turns
Use the turn loop:
World Phase — Something changes
System Phase — Pressure increases
Player Phase — Each player chooses an action
Integration Phase — Describe the cost
Repeat.
End the Session
End when:
Something important changes
Someone fractures
Or everyone agrees to stop
Say one sentence each about what remains.
That’s the ending.
Remember
You do not win by overpowering.
You win by staying present long enough to matter.

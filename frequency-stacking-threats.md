Frequency Stacking — Threat Tiers, Champions & Collapse Scenarios
Threats are not enemies.
They are pressures reaching critical mass.
Threat Tiers
Tier 1 — Background Pressure
Subtle, constant, invisible.
Examples:
Notifications without senders
Tasks without owners
Emotions without causes
Effect: Slow erosion of PRE and COH.
Tier 2 — Active Distortion
Pressure becomes visible.
Examples:
Memory inconsistencies
Identity swaps
Reality lag
Effect: System introduces temptations and trade-offs.
Tier 3 — Extraction Events
The System begins harvesting.
Examples:
Emotional Harvest
Narrative Rewrite
Connection Monetization
Effect: Players must sacrifice something meaningful.
Tier 4 — Collapse Signals
Warning signs before failure.
Examples:
Repeating scenes
People losing names
Time stuttering
Effect: Fracture risk increases.
Tier 5 — Collapse
Irreversible destabilization.
Examples:
Reality loops
Identity shatter
Meaning loss
Effect: Session enters Endgame.
Champions
Champions are emergent.
They appear when coherence becomes rare.
A Champion:
Absorbs Tier 3+ pressure
Anchors meaning locally
Prevents total collapse
They always lose something in exchange.
Champions do not survive unchanged.
Collapse Scenarios
Total Collapse
The world resets. Players forget each other.
Partial Collapse
Some cities fall. Others stabilize.
Transcendent Collapse
The system is rewritten. The world becomes something else.
Stillness Collapse
Players refuse escalation. The world slows or stops.
Design Ethos
Escalation is not about danger.
It is about cost.
The world does not attack.
It extracts.

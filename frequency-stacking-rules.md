Frequency Stacking — Core Rules (v1.0)
A cooperative mythic coherence game.
This is not a game about winning.
It is a game about staying.
Staying human.
Staying coherent.
Staying present in a world that keeps trying to move you faster.
You do not turn on a machine.
You turn on yourself.
You wrap sound around your nervous system.
You ride resonance through collapsing corridors of reality.
You glow.
You move faster than time.
And slowly, if no one is watching, you forget who you were before you glowed.
This game is about what happens next.
There are no villains here. Only costs.
Your job is not to avoid cost.
Your job is to choose which cost you are willing to carry.
That is what makes you a player.
1. Game Overview
Players: 2–5 players + optional Guide
Mode: Cooperative, with optional asymmetric pressure role
Session Length: 60–180 minutes
Goal: Maintain coherence long enough to transform the world without losing yourself.
There is no victory. There are outcomes.
2. Core Concepts
Each player has four attributes:
Coherence (COH) — Emotional and identity stability
Resonance (RES) — Power to affect the world
Presence (PRE) — Awareness of what matters
Integrity (INT) — Resistance to corruption and extraction
Each starts at 5
Maximum is 10
Minimum is 0 (collapse threshold)
3. Collapse & Fracture
If any attribute reaches 0, the player enters a Fracture State.
Fractured players:
Cannot take Resonance actions
Speak only in distorted narrative
May only recover through Rest or Connection
If two or more players fracture at once, the world destabilizes and the session enters Endgame.
4. Turn Structure
Each round has four phases:
1. World Phase
The Guide introduces a System Pressure, such as:
Time acceleration
Scarcity event
Emotional extraction
Narrative distortion
Algorithmic drift
2. System Phase
The System reacts:
Introduces new costs
Amplifies pressure
Offers temptations
Accelerates time
Triggers cost events
(If using the optional role, the System Conduit embodies this.)
3. Player Phase
Each player chooses one action:
Act
Use Resonance to change the world.
Roll: RES + PRE vs System Difficulty
Success → Change happens
Failure → Change happens with cost
Rest
Recover:
Restore 1–3 COH or INT (choose one)
Connect
Restore 1 PRE or COH to another player
Builds narrative bonds
Resist
Roll INT + COH to negate a System effect.
4. Integration Phase
Players describe what changed — and what it cost.
5. Cost System
Every powerful action introduces a cost.
Cost types include:
Effect — A condition persists
Memory — Lose or distort a backstory detail
Time — Skip next turn
Connection — Lose access to another player temporarily
Artifact — Sacrifice or corrupt an artifact
Identity — Lose 1 COH permanently unless healed
Costs must be accepted — not avoided.
6. Artifacts
Artifacts stabilize meaning.
Examples:
Songs
Letters
Objects
Memories
Tokens
Artifacts can:
Prevent fractures
Absorb costs
Anchor reality
Artifacts can be:
Lost
Corrupted
Gifted
Sacrificed
7. Optional Role — System Conduit
One player may embody the System.
They do not try to win.
They:
Introduce temptations
Accelerate time
Offer deals
Trigger cost events
They gain power when players choose speed over meaning.
This role rotates every session.
8. Ending a Session
A session ends when:
A transformation completes
The world collapses
Everyone fractures
Or players choose to stop
The outcome is measured by:
What remains
Who is still present
What was saved
9. End States
Possible outcomes:
Meaning — Something changed that mattered
Transcendence — Players evolved beyond the system
Stability — Collapse was prevented
Drift — The world moved on
Shatter — The system won
Stillness — Players chose to stop
None are wrong.
10. Tone & Safety
This is a reflective game.
No player should:
Be shamed
Be trapped
Be forced into emotional exposure
Players may pause or exit at any time.
11. Design Ethos
The world rewards speed.
The game rewards coherence.

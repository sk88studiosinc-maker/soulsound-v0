Frequency Stacking — Classes & Roles
Classes describe how a player moves through pressure.
They are not professions. They are orientations toward the world.
Each class is balanced. Each carries different risks. Each preserves different kinds of meaning.
1. Stillpoint
Theme: Stability, grounding, coherence.
Stillpoints are anchors. They slow the world by staying present inside it.
They are often quiet. They notice what others overlook. They hold space.
Strengths:
Excellent at Rest and Connection
Can stabilize Fractures
Resist System pressures more easily
Risks:
Attract Isolation costs
Risk becoming irrelevant if ignored
Special: Once per session, a Stillpoint may restore 1 COH to all players.
2. Listener
Theme: Awareness, interpretation, narrative clarity.
Listeners hear what the world is saying beneath the noise.
They notice patterns. They detect distortion. They translate chaos into meaning.
Strengths:
Excellent at detecting System Pressure
Gain bonuses when resisting distortion
Can reveal hidden costs or truths
Risks:
Attract Memory and Identity costs
Risk losing themselves in what they observe
Special: Once per session, a Listener may negate a Narrative Distortion or Memory cost.
3. Guardian
Theme: Protection, boundaries, sacrifice.
Guardians place themselves between others and harm.
They absorb pressure. They take on cost so others don’t have to. They hold lines.
Strengths:
Excellent at absorbing or redirecting costs
Can protect Artifacts or other players
Can prevent fractures
Risks:
Attract Physical, Time, and Scarcity costs
Risk burning out or disappearing
Special: Once per session, a Guardian may take a cost meant for another player.
